<h1>Mountains</h1>

<p>A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally considered to be steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth.A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak.
